# Task-Manager-Backend
 Here’s a brief description:  Node.js: This is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. It’s used for building fast and scalable network applications. In our case, it’s the foundation of our Task Manager backend. Express.js: This is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It’s used in our Task Manager backend to create the API endpoints that our frontend will interact with. Task Management: The backend handles various task-related operations. These include creating a new task, fetching all tasks, updating a task by its ID, and deleting a task. Each task can have properties like ‘title’, ‘description’, ‘status’, etc. Database: The backend also interacts with a database (like MongoDB) to persist the task data. It uses an ORM/ODM (like Mongoose) to handle database operations. Middleware: Express.js middleware functions are used for handling requests, responses, and the next middleware in the application’s request-response cycle. These functions can perform tasks like authentication, validation, error handling, etc. Routes: The backend defines various routes (like /tasks, /tasks/:id, etc.) corresponding to different operations.
